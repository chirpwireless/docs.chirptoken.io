# Phase II – Launch Stage – 2023 

## Mobile App 
During the launch stage in 2023, Chirp is set to take the wireless industry by storm with the release of its mobile app. This app will allow users to easily manage their Chirp devices, access the full range of features available on the Chirp Dashboard, and even link it with other mobile applications for enhanced convenience.

## New Financing Rounds
In addition to the mobile app, Chirp will also be undertaking a series of funding rounds to support the continued development and growth of the network. These rounds will include a Bundle Sale, where a Blackbird Miner and tokens will be sold at a discounted rate, a seed round open to large investment funds with a minimum investment of 1M$, and an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO).

## Working on the Crypto side
To further solidify the network, Chirp has enlisted the help of Zokyo Labs for their token/crypto architecture services. Zokyo will assist in creating a specific crypto solution tailored to the needs of the Chirp Network, including the architecture of the Distributed Ledger Technology, the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications, and the implementation of a consensus mechanism.

## Integration and Monetization
In addition to the technology, Chirp is also focusing on IoT device integration, allowing for the connection of various sensors, smart plugs, and other devices using protocols such as BLE, LoRa, and Thread. Monetization is also a key aspect of the launch stage, with the implementation of systems that reward Miner Operators and enable the transaction of tokens for data traffic.

## Enhanced, future-proof security
Security is a top priority for Chirp, and as such, a comprehensive security audit will be conducted to ensure the hackability of the network and protect against any potential risks or exploits. The first batch of Blackbird Gateways will also be shipped out to their owners during this stage.

## Beta Launch
The beta launch marks the culmination of all the hard work and effort put in by the Chirp team, as a functioning product is released on the market with all the expected features ready for use. This will be used for testing, tweaking, and improving the network until a final form can be achieved.

## Launching on the Crypto Market! 
Finally, the User Dashboard will be made available to all users of the Chirp Network and the IEO will mark the token's debut on the open crypto market through various centralised and decentralised exchanges. The Sales Team will also be put in place to ensure the acquisition of customers and partners to ensure the continued growth and success of the Chirp Network.
