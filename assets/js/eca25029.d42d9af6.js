The goal is to provide excellent network coverage for our clients, and that means setting up the antenna in a "set and forget" area where you will not be tempted to unplug or move it after the installation. It\'s important to keep the antenna plugged in and online, as your rewards coefficient may decrease if it goes offline, and it will be more difficult to reach the same coefficient again. After installing the antenna, you will need to submit a picture of your setup for our review and approval. Once approved, your gateway will be registered as a miner on our network, and once in mainnet  you will start receiving rewards in the form of $CHIRP tokens.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It's important to note that the higher your antenna is, the better chance it has of receiving extra rewards.
