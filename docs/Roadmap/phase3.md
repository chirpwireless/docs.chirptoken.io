# Phase III – Growth&Diversification – 2024

## Launching Chirp's Mesh 
Phase 3 of the Chirp project, set to launch in 2024, is focused on growth and diversification. One of the major developments during this phase is the implementation of a mesh network, which utilizes multiple "nodes" (Blackbirds) to extend the radio signal and improve connectivity. This system minimizes the possibility of dead zones and reduces the risk of connectivity failure, as each node in the network has multiple ways to send and receive information. This means that if one node breaks, another one can pick up the signal and replace it, ensuring a seamless experience for the end user.

## Launch of the Cardinal 
Another major development during this phase is the expansion of broadband internet capabilities through the Cardinal. Using the latest advances in wireless fibre-over-air internet technology, the Chirp team will be working to provide faster and more reliable internet access to users.

## Full Release of Chirp's Mesh
The launch of the Mainnet, marking the end of the testnet and the beginning of the final form of the Mesh Chirp Network, with all functionality enabled, is a significant milestone in this phase as well. This launch will enable the full capabilities of the network, providing users with access to all of its features and functionalities.

## 5G and Broadband
Another important aspect of this phase is the rollout of ISP and 5G capabilities. The Cardinal, an internet antenna capable of providing fibre-speed internet (speeds over 1 Gb) to multiple people in range, will be available for purchase and installation. People can contribute to the purchase and installation and get rewarded proportional to their original investment. Additionally, 5G will be introduced as a protocol on the Chirp Network, allowing users to install Chirp 5G Antennas.

## Focusing on Business Development and Usage
Lastly, customer acquisition will be a key focus during this phase, as the team looks to see actual profitable usage of the network across many different industries and create real value in industry and commercial activities. With the successful implementation of these developments, Chirp will be well-positioned to continue growing and diversifying in the years to come.
