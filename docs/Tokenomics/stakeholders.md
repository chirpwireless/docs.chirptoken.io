# Stakeholders

In the process of creating the Chirp project model, seven types of stakeholders were identified. 

We define a stakeholder as an entity, an individual or a group of individuals, a company or a group of companies (and any entity of individuals or companies). Each stakeholder has its own behavior in tokenomics cycles and significantly affects the entire tokenomics of the project.

A table describing the types of stakeholders, as well as their actions concerning Chirp network.

## Type Of Stakeholder

## Network Users
Connect devices to the network and purchase Access Badges for the purposes of using the network.

## Network Keepers
A stakeholder that purchases hardware in order to provide coverage for the network and is rewarded for that coverage and transmitting data in the Chirp networks.

By providing coverage to the Chirp networks, Network Keepers become the basis agent for the network, and thus entitled to other opportunities within the network, namely for access and to act as community leaders.

## Investors
Individuals or companies participating in the investment rounds. Investors purchase the right to receive future emissions (token distribution) at a discounted rate and can make a profit that is dependent on the appreciation of the token value or on the resale of their rights.

## Chirp Team 
The Chirp team (which includes founders) is responsible for designing and implementing the network and its token economy. These agents will be rewarded in tokens and be able to exchange them in the open market (exchanges).

## Token Holders
Token Holders are able to participate in Governance-voting decisions.

## Speculators
Trade tokens on an exchange for the purpose of making a profit (either by token price increase or decrease).

## Telecommunication Partners
Third parties that partner with Chirp Network to provide infrastructure access to support communications, outside of the immediate reach of the communication signals and technologies directly provided by Network Keepers.

These agents are entitled to payments from the network for the usage of their infrastructure.
