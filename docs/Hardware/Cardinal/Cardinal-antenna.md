# Cardinal Antennas

In order to become an Internet Service Provider (ISP), an optical fibre connection found in the general proximity (e.g. Cogent, Arelion, Liberty Global) is used to beam data from to the main Cardinal Antenna Emitter on top of a well-placed radio tower using the 60GHz frequency band. The maximum distance for this connection is estimated at around 8 km. 

Cardinal Emitters must be installed in a very good location within line-of-sight to their clients or target community. Clients can receive extremely high speed, up to and above Giga-byte speed, by connecting with a Receiver antenna placed outside of their home or apartment, which can act as a nearby Wireless Router from which it is possible to connect over wi-fi or ethernet cables. 

The connection between the Cardinal and the end-user is managed over the 16 GHz band, except when the weather is very poor or obstructions are in the way, decreasing range. In this case, a 5GHz back-up link can be achieved, the same frequency used in the newest and highest speed Wi-Fi routers.

Multiple Cardinal Antennas can be installed on the same tower to increase the number of people that can be serviced in the general area. Normally, there is a maximum number of people that can connect to a single Cardinal Antenna Device, and the area of coverage is limited to a roughly 120 degree cone in front of the Emitter Antenna.

Three Cardinal Antennas can provide bandwidth of up to 16.2 Gbps, divided, at most, to 45 end-users. The maximum possible bandwidth that a single Client can take is 5.4Gbps. The Receiver Antenna itself uses the 5 GHz frequency band to transmit the internet, similar to a modern WiFi router.

An installation of multiple Cardinals on the same tower is called a Cardinal Nest or Hub. Nearby Cardinal Hubs can create a Mesh network that allows them to transfer information or connect to each other. The Mesh Network makes it possible for other Cardinal Antennas to cover the loss or breakdown of a different Cardinal, making sure that the end user never feels the loss of connection, but is instead able to continue browser the internet normally, with no knowledge of a problem.
