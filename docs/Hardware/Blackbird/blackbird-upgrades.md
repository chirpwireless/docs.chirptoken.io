# Blackbird Upgrades

Technology is advancing incredibly fast. In a frontier technological field such as the Internet-of-Things, a few years could result in fundamental changes to the usability and function of a device. In order for the long-term ambition of Chirp to be possible, the mistakes of projects that came before us must not be repeated, and thus, upgrading the **[Blackbird](docs/Hardware/Blackbird.md)** was assured from the very start.

## Easy, Modular and Future-proof 

Due to the existence of multiple independent IoT technologies, a decision was made early about the architecture of the **[Blackbird](docs/Hardware/Blackbird.md)**. Wherever possible, the internal components were made as modular as possible in order to assure that non-experts and non-technical people. 

## Hardware Upgrades

Modularity means that individual section of the internal components of the **[Blackbird](docs/Hardware/Blackbird.md)** can be simply removed with no specialized tools, just a screwdriver and patience. Replacing them is as simple as cleaning up a laptop or replacing a hard-drive. 

For **[Zigbee](docs/IoT-Protocols/Zigbee/zigbee-intro.md)** Modules and newly added IoT Protocols expected in the future, considering that these are from the start defined as optional and are installed using plug-and-play USB dongles, upgrades would be as easy as simply replacing an USB stick. 

## Software

Software updates are expected to happen on-the-fly periodically. This does not require any particular action by the User. When turned off due to cost of data over LTE and Satellite, doing the upgrades on site by manually connecting to your **[Blackbird](docs/Hardware/Blackbird.md)** is also possible. 

## Financing

For 30 years of usage, replacement of the main IoT technologies can be scheduled periodically, for example once every 3 years. By purchasing the modules through Chirp you are guaranteed compatibility with the Network and Devices, and you will receive additional discounts or improved rewards through mining on the Chirp Network. 

One example scenario is that of the Austrian Backpack – a part of the mining rewards that would’ve otherwise been burned can be blocked in a savings account, and these can be sold to Chirp for discounts or to cover the purchase of components for upgrading your **[Blackbird](docs/Hardware/Blackbird.md)**, which will improve the properties, usability and rewards associated with your **[Blackbird Miner](docs/Hardware/Blackbird.md)** .
