Semtech Chipsets

## Who is Semtech?
Semtech is the provider of multiple new and innovative semiconductor devices required in the creation of advanced LoRa products. They are one of the most important actors in the adoption of LoRa as a leading IoT communication protocol in commercial applications for the expansion of IoT.
Chirp makes use of novel innovative chipsets created by LoRa to implement the cutting-edge version of LoRa made available in recent years, enhancing the functionality of the network from the start with respect to improving compatibility, reach, data rate, eliminating regional barriers, improving location accuracy, and many others. 
## Semtech SX1280
SX1280 | Long range, low power 2.4GHz RF Transceiver | Semtech
The Semtech SX 1280 chipset is the essential addition to the Blackbird that enables ultra long range communication with great resistance to heavy interference and global compatibility with all LoRa devices on the market because of the introduction of **2.4 GHz LoRa**. Check out Chirp’s Wiki entry on **[Wi-Fi and BLE immunity]()** and Semtech’s articles (Salesforce BLE, Salesforce Wi-fi).
## Semtech SX1303
The SX1303 is the newest generation of LoRa chipsets, which result in extremely good **[geo-location detection]()** because of the introduction of Fine Timestamp capability. This means that the Gateway (in our case the Blackbird) has a much better internal clock that can be used in the algorithm used to interpret the time taken for a LoRa signal to reach to and from a LoRa device and several Gateways into their precise position in space. In addition, the SX1303 also provides lowered power consumption and a smaller overall size.
NOTE: With the SX 1303 a device does not need any sort of GPS or location indicator! Anything, including a simle temperature sensor or a smart plug can be located just from the time it takes to respond to a chirp signal sent by our Blackbird.
## Why should I care?
Because LoRa chipsets are at the very core of the Blackbirds, upgrading them in older devices from other networks requires a complete recall of all of the LoRa Gateways for the replacement of the chipset in order to make the new functionalities available. Firmware upgrades are limited in older devices and, thus, it is a very important unique benefit of Chirp compared to older legacy Networks to be able to roll-out the most novel solution from the start.
