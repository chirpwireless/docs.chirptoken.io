# Troubleshooting IoT connectivity issues
With the increased reliance on IoT devices comes a new set of challenges, one of which is sporadic connectivity issues. Whether it's devices that won't connect to the internet, or those that experience intermittent connectivity, troubleshooting IoT connectivity issues can be a headache. Here are some common IoT connectivity issues and how to troubleshoot them:

1.	Blackbird is not connecting to the internet: This is one of the most common issues and can be caused by a number of factors. The first step is to check that the Blackbird is properly configured and that all the necessary software is up to date – for example, you may be able to use a checksum or the firmware version printed on the box to compare with the latest version from the dashboard. Make sure that the device is within range of the WiFi network and that the network's credentials are entered correctly. Additionally, check that the device is not blocked by a firewall or other security measures.
2.	Intermittent connectivity: If a device is experiencing intermittent connectivity, it could be caused by a weak signal or interference from other devices. Move the device closer to the router or gateway to improve the signal strength. Additionally, try to reduce the number of devices connected to the same network, as this can cause congestion and slow down connections. The Blackbird itself does not need a large amount of data bandwidth to operate correctly, however it does, most importantly, need continuous connection to the internet to be able to constantly monitor devices and communicate the data to the network.
3.	Devices are not connecting to the gateway: This issue can occur if the gateway is not properly configured or if there is a problem with the network. Make sure that the gateway is properly configured and that all necessary software is up to date. Additionally, check that the gateway is not blocked by a firewall or other security measures. If only some of the IoT protocols are not working as expected, consider running the Chirp troubleshooter to identify whether there may be a software or hardware issue at fault. 
4.	Devices are not showing up in the app or dashboard: If a device is not showing up in the app or dashboard, it could be caused by a problem with the device or the network. Make sure that the device is properly configured and that all necessary software is up to date. The most likely reason is that you did not finish the Blackbird Configuration Routine and that you have not yet received all necessary approvals due to the Master Nodes or the nearby validated Blackbirds being overloaded, the smart contracts and cloud applications experiencing downtime, the Blackbird not managing to connect to the GPS satellite due to improper placement, possibly due to being covered or indoors, or the codes and QR codes involved in KYC or Blackbird authentication not being used correctly.  
5.	Devices are not responding to commands: This issue can occur if there is a problem with the device or the network. Make sure that the device is properly configured to accept commands. In the case of LoRa devices, this implies having type B or C enabled in their respective firmware. Please keep in mind that this may cause the power consumption of the device to increase significantly, thus making it more likely for the battery to run out or for the signal strength to decrease over time, leading to the lack of responsiveness. Furthermore, make sure that the dashboard shows the device as such, to rule out any sort of incompatibilities or identification errors between the device and the network.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to resolve some of the most common IoT connectivity issues. Remember that it's always a good idea to consult the device's user manual or contact the manufacturer's support team for additional help. Additionally, it's important to keep your Blackbird’s software updated and to ensure that your network is secure to prevent future connectivity issues.
