# Keepers

Keepers are owners and operators of Blackbirds, Chirp's IoT Miner. To become a Keeper, you should purchase and install a Blackbird and successfully provide IoT coverage for the network. 

Blackbirds are associated with the person who registers them. Therefore, becoming a Keeper requires going through the hardware installation and the process of registration onto the Network.  
 
## Earning Tokens

As a reward for their role in Chirp's Ecosystem, Network Keepers earn  $Chirp tokens from one of two distinct sources:

- Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) rewards, which represent the reward for providing network coverage over an area and is shared between all Keepers from a pool defined in the Tokenomics Document. This tends to be the dominant reward mechanism during the early stages.
- Traffic Fees, which are earned as a share of the cost of data traffic sent over the Chirp Network, and which pass through the Blackbird laid out by the Keeper. These vary significantly depending on the level of IoT Usage in your area, howver, as the network grows, they are expected to become the dominant reward mechanism, surpassing PoC.

## Cardinal

Participating in later developments of the Chirp Network, such as the launch of Cardinal, the internet broadband connectivity solution that Chirp is working on, requires participants to first become a Keeper in order to qualify. 

## Governance 

In addition, Keepers may participate in the governance process on the Chirp Network, voting for decisions that affect them, and making an impact onto the Chirp Ecosystem.

!NOTE! Because Blackbirds are registered to the Keeper's wallet, a stolen Blackbird properly installed and engaged in the process of Mining by providing IoT Coverage would continue to pay the Chirp Token rewards in the wallet of their rightfull Keeper.
