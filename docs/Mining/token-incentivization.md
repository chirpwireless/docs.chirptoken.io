# Token-based incentivization

## What is it?
Token-based incentivization is a mechanism that uses cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize certain behavior in an Internet of Things (IoT) network such as Chirp. By providing rewards in the form of tokens, network participants are incentivized to perform certain actions that benefit the network as a whole, such as expanding the network's reach or increasing the availability and bandwidth for the network. This can include other actions as well, such as providing data processing capacity, or contributing other resources.

## Driver of Decentralization
One of the main advantages of token-based incentivization is that it can help to create a decentralized and self-sustaining network. This is because tokens can be used to align the interests of network participants with the overall goals of the network. For example, if a network is designed to provide coverage in a certain area, token rewards can be used to incentivize individuals or organizations to deploy devices that provide that coverage.

Another advantage of token-based incentivization is that it can be used to create a network that is resistant to centralization. This is because tokens can be distributed fairly and transparently, making it difficult for a single entity to control the network. Additionally, tokens can be used to create a marketplace where resources can be traded and allocated efficiently and by the collaboration of multiple stakeholders and contributors to the Chirp network.

## The Blockchain/DLT 
One of the main challenges of token-based incentivization is that it requires a robust and secure blockchain infrastructure to support it. This infrastructure must be able to handle the large number of transactions that occur in an IoT network, as well as provide a secure and transparent way to track and distribute tokens. Additionally, the network must be designed in such a way that the token rewards are fair and proportional to the contributions made by network participants.

## Promoting Growth
Overall, token-based incentivization is a promising approach for creating decentralized and self-sustaining IoT networks. Previous projects in the decentralized IoT space showed that successful implementations of this concept can provide an edge in deploying at a very fast pace the required infrastructure without direct intervention - because adequate incentives were shown to go a long way into motivating people to contribute and also get rewarded generously for their contribution, all in a decentralized manner.
