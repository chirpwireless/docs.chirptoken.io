## What is the Blackbird?

The Blackbird is Chirpâ€™s flagship IoT Gateway,  joining together in a single plug-and-play box all of the major IoT protocols: **LoRa** ,  **BLE** , **Zigbee** and **Thread**. The Blackbird doubles down as a IoT Gateway, an antenna device that provides wireless coverage for the IoT, as well as a Crypto miner.

## What is a Keeper

As each device that pays to connect to the Chirp Network routes its traffic through one of the user-installed Blackbirds around the world, and the traffic is transformed into rewards for the Owner and Operator of the Blackbird, its **[Keeper](../keepers.md)**.

## What does the Blackbird do?

The Blackbird is a point of communication between IoT devices, which transmit radio signals containing a variety of data types and information, and the end-user. In essence, the Blackbird translates the language of the IoT (the communication protocols) and transforms it in a way in which it can be transmitted to the internet, and then understood and used by the **Chirp Dashboard**, the webpage and mobile application where all of your IoT functionality is concentrated. 

For the latter stage, different applications can be run remotely on the cloud using **Cloud Applications** and **[Smart Contracts](../smart-contracts.md)**, and this will be further discussed on their own Wiki Entries.

## How can I become a Keeper?

Installing a Blackbird is simplified to its core, as it was entirely developed and designed in-house by the Chirp Team. 

It functions as a plug-and-play device, connected to an antenna on one side, the internet through an ethernet cable or WiFi, and powered up using the same ethernet cable. Only on the Blackbirds operated using WiFi, a separate power cable needs to be connected. 

For enthusiasts and maximizers, it is possible to use either the antenna provided in the kit or a custom one of your choosing, perhaps one that provides higher gain, is bigger or already installed.
