# Chirp Tokens

Chirp tokens are the cryptocurrency used to consolidate value on the Chirp Network. It is used by Users of both the IoT and the ISP side to access the network and buy IoT coverage or wireless broadband connection, and it is also used to reward **[Keepers](docs/Chirp-Technology/keepers.md)** or Cardinal DAO investors. 

## Chirp Token Creation

The Chirp token is created through mining by owning and correctly operating proprietary Chirp Hardware such as the IoT **[Blackbird](docs/Hardware/Blackbird/Blackbird.md)** or the Cardinal. 

The mining process involves providing wireless coverage to nearby Users who wish to access the network, and making it possible for them to transfer and exchange data between IoT devices and the internet, or connecting them to the internet at fiber speeds.

Chirp Tokens created from the Proof-of-Coverage process early on are newly minted tokens that first appear at the time when they are bought by the User who buys IoT Data Credits or a Wireless Broadband Subscription using Fiat Money through, for example, a Credit Card on-ramp.

Chirp Tokens that are received by the **[Keepers](docs/Chirp-Technology/keepers.md)** who facilitate the transfer of data through the **[Blackbird](docs/Hardware/Blackbird/Blackbird.md)** they own, or participants in the installation of a Cardinal through the DAO, are Tokens that are reminted from the burning of Data Credits, the fixed price utility token that translates between the variable price of the Chirp token and the amount of data that someone can transmit through the Network. 

Thus, increasing the usage of the Chirp Network does not inflate the amount of tokens in circulation, but rather burns existing tokens and deflates the total supply.

Stolen **[Blackbirds](docs/Hardware/Blackbird/Blackbird.md)** that can be validated will continue to generate tokens for the original **[Keeper](docs/Chirp-Technology/keepers.md)**.  A thief cannot register the **[Blackbird](docs/Hardware/Blackbird/Blackbird.md)** to their own wallet or account, and the location of the **[Blackbird](docs/Hardware/Blackbird/Blackbird.md)** can be verified through GPS and LoRa at extreme accuracy.
