# Service Level Agreement

## What is it?

The Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an important condition in order to provide the same or better quality internet as any existing Internet Provider, and fulfilling every condition to be qualified as a fully functional and legal decentralized internet service provider.

## What is the relation with Chirpâ€™s Mesh?

Chirp is able to provide the SLA using a Mesh network, where every Cardinal Antenna in range is in permanent communication with every other. Because of this, the other Cardinal can take over the functions of the one that is broken or turned off.

Our Mesh technology includes both the broadband Cardinal and is tested beforehand on the IoT side, using the Blackbird. A Mesh network makes the rerouting of internet signal possible, because it acts almost immediately to keep alive the connection between the Internet and the Client. 

## Why is this important?

The Service-level Agreement (SLA) makes Chirp is the first decentralized broadband provider capable to provide a decentralized solution.
The Client is not impacted by failures of the Antennas and Devices, weather and obstructions, power outages on the power source for the Cardinal, and many others. Furthermore, dividing internet demand to nearby Cardinal antennas makes it possible to improve the profitability of the network.

A client who wishes to use the Cardinal to access very high speed fibre internet over air, without cables, requires ownership of a Receiver Antenna and an internet subscription paid through credit or debit card as a fiat on-ramp used to buy Chirp Tokens. 

The cost of the Cardinal itself is divided between all of the participants in the DAO, who are also entitled to the ownership of the Cardinal and proportional profits from its operation. 

These participants in the DAO and later Governance depend on the good function and the attractiveness of the Service offered by the Cardinal, and thus most definitely need the SLA as a guarantee of technical soundness and market readiness for the technology, so that their investment can be returned and profits generated.
