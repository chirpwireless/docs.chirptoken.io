# From Zigbee to Thread
## What is Thread?
Developed by the Thread Group, a consortium of companies that includes Google, Nest, and Samsung, Thread is a low-power, mesh networking protocol that is designed specifically for IoT devices. Unlike Zigbee and Z-Wave, Thread uses IP-based communication, which means that it can easily integrate with other IP-based networks and devices. This makes it a great choice for smart home applications, as it can easily connect to and communicate with other devices such as smartphones, tablets, and PCs. Additionally, Thread uses AES-128 encryption for security, which is a higher level of security than Zigbee and Z-Wave.

With the introduction of Thread, the IoT community now has access to a more secure, low-power, and reliable communication protocol that can support a larger number of devices. The protocol also supports IPv6 addressing, which allows for a virtually unlimited number of devices to be connected to the network. Additionally, it utilizes a mesh network topology, which provides  a more robust and resilient network that can handle more devices and handle more demanding applications such as home automation and industrial IoT.

Similarly to the other IoT protocols discussed, Thread has the ability to support devices with limited resources such as battery-powered devices. The protocol's low power requirements allow for devices to run for months on a single battery charge.  

Thread is also designed to be highly scalable, with the ability to support hundreds of devices on a single local network. This makes it a great choice for large-scale IoT deployments. In addition, Thread is designed to be highly reliable, with built-in mechanisms for self-healing and self-organizing networks. This means that if a device or network connection is lost, the network will automatically reconfigure itself to maintain connectivity, something that other protocols do not natively support, where mesh is not a simple and the default configuration.

In conclusion, the evolution of IoT communication protocols has brought about significant advancements in terms of security, power efficiency, and scalability. We are seeing a shift from proprietary protocols such as Zigbee and Z-Wave, to open standards such as Thread, which are designed to be highly scalable and reliable, and easily integrate with other IP-based networks and devices. The choice of protocol will depend on the specific needs of the application and the devices being used. However, for large-scale IoT deployments, or for applications that require high levels of security and reliability, Thread is a great choice.
