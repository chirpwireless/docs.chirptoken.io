2. **Transaction Confirmation**:  
   * A confirmation request will appear on your Ledger device screen.  
   * Carefully review the transaction details displayed on the Ledger device, including the amount, recipient address, and other parameters.  
   * If all the details are correct and the transaction appears valid, press "Confirm" on the Ledger to complete the withdrawal process.
