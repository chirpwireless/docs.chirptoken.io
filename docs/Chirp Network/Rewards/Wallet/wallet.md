# How to Connect Your Wallet and Withdraw Tokens

To claim your rewards, you need to connect your Sui wallet to the Chirp platform.

**Important**: Wallet connection, disconnection, and rewards claims are only available through the Sui extension on a desktop, as the Sui wallet can only be connected via the desktop version.

## What's a Sui wallet?

A Sui wallet is like a digital bank account for your tokens. The Sui wallet is a specific type of wallet that you need to install in your browser.

Even if you're not familiar with cryptocurrency wallets, don't worry — just follow these steps:

## Steps to Connect Your Wallet and Withdraw Tokens

### 1. Go to the Chirp platform

- On your computer, open your internet browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
- Go to [app.chirpwireless.io](https://app.chirpwireless.io).

### 2. Log in to your account using the same ID you use in the game

- Use the same username and password that you created when signing up for the Kage game.
- If you forgot your password, look for the "Forgot Password" link and follow the steps to reset it.

After this, you should see a message confirming that the wallet was successfully added. Next, you need to verify it. You will be redirected to Sui, where you should press the **"Sign"** button. Once this is done, the wallet will be added to your account on the Chirp platform and Kage game.

- Enter the number of tokens you want to withdraw, or simply click the **“Max”** button to withdraw the maximum number of tokens to your wallet.

## What happens next?

CHIRP tokens will be transferred to your Sui wallet, where you can hold onto them, use them for Chirp platform features, or eventually convert them through a cryptocurrency exchange.
