## 2. How to Export a Seed Phrase from Ledger

1. **What is a Seed Phrase?**

   A seed phrase (or recovery phrase) is a set of 24 words generated when setting up your Ledger device. It is used to recover access to your wallet in case the device is lost or reset.

2. **Accessing the Seed Phrase**

   Ledger does not allow you to view the seed phrase after the initial setup. If you haven’t saved it, you won’t be able to recover your wallet later.

   - If you lose the seed phrase, you won’t be able to access the funds in your wallet. In this case, you will need to reset the device and create a new wallet.

3. **How to Export a Seed Phrase**

   While the seed phrase cannot be exported directly, you can reset the device and create a new wallet:

   1. **Reset the Device**:
      - Open the Ledger Live app and go to device settings.
      - Choose the reset option to erase all data.
   2. **Create a New Wallet**:
      - Follow the on-screen instructions to set up a new wallet with a new seed phrase. Write it down and store it securely.

4. **Seed Phrase Security**

- Never share your seed phrase with anyone.
- Store the seed phrase securely to avoid losing access to your funds.
