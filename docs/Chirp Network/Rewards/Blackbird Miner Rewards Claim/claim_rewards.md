   - Officially Supported Wallets:
     - Chirp Wireless officially supports the SUI Wallet for token withdrawals. Make sure to use a supported wallet to ensure smooth transactions.
     - If your wallet is not officially supported, the transaction might fail or not be processed correctly. In such cases, we recommend switching to an officially supported wallet like the SUI Wallet or contacting Chirp's customer support for further guidance.
   - If the SUI Wallet is not yet installed, follow the installation guide for the Chrome extension available on the SUI Wallet's resource [page](https://blog.sui.io/sui-wallets/).
   - To add the wallet to the Chirp Wireless platform, follow the instructions provided via [link](https://docs.chirptoken.io/Chirp%20Network/Rewards/).
5. **Confirm the Transaction in SUI Wallet**:
   - A request for transaction confirmation will appear in the SUI Wallet extension.
   - Carefully review the transaction details and click "Confirm" (or the equivalent button) to complete the transfer to your SUI Wallet.
6. **Wait for the Transaction to Complete**:
   - After confirming the transaction, the funds will be transferred from Chirp Wireless to your SUI Wallet. The app will notify you when the transaction is complete.
7. **Check the Balance in SUI Wallet**:
   - Open the SUI Wallet through the Chrome extension and verify that the funds have been credited to your wallet. The balance should update to reflect the received funds.
