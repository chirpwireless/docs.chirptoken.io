# Installing and registering your Blackbird

## Welcome, Keeper!

We are thrilled to have you join the Chirp network as a gateway Keeper. As you may know, the gateway is an essential component of the Chirp network, providing wireless coverage and enabling devices to communicate with each other.

We are excited to announce that the first batch of Chirp miners will be shipped out in June 2023 to 26 countries around the world. This is a significant milestone for Chirp, as we believe that the power of people and web3 will help us expand the network quickly.

We are grateful for your support and commitment to this project. As an early adopter, you play a crucial role in building the foundation of the Chirp network. We recognize that this is a special moment for you as well, as you have been with us from the very beginning.

While we are currently approaching the test net, we are confident that the main net launch is just around the corner. Once the main net is launched, the tokens will be evenly distributed among gateway keepers. As one of our earliest backers and a Keeper, you will be rewarded with the most tokens, as there are only a few gateways on the network at this stage. We value your contribution and trust in our vision, and we are committed to making Chirp a successful and sustainable project.

Thank you again for being a part of the Chirp network. Let's get started with the installation process!

## Play By the rules 

Before converting your gateway into a miner and start receiving rewards in the form of $CHIRP token, it is important to understand the proper installation process and the rules that apply to becoming a Keeper.

First, it's essential to note that the hardware you received is a gateway that is already pre-registered on our network. As soon as it is plugged in, it provides network coverage for devices within a large area around you. In the future, corporations may purchase gateways to extend or strengthen the signal at their properties, and they might not be interested in mining. Therefore, they can install the gateway as and where they please. However, as a Keeper, you will be rewarded for the proper installation of the gateway that extends the signal beyond your home.

To convert your gateway into a miner and start receiving rewards, an antenna needs to be installed on the outside of your home and as high as possible. For apartment buildings, window and balcony installations are allowed. For single-family homes, only roof installations are permitted. The goal is to provide excellent network coverage for our clients, and that means setting up the antenna in a "set and forget" area where you will not be tempted to unplug or move it after the installation. It's important to keep the antenna plugged in and online, as your rewards coefficient may decrease if it goes offline, and it will be more difficult to reach the same coefficient again. After installing the antenna, you will need to submit a picture of your setup for our review and approval. Once approved, your gateway will be registered as a miner on our network, and once in mainnet  you will start receiving rewards in the form of $CHIRP tokens.

It's important to note that the higher your antenna is, the better chance it has of receiving extra rewards. If your miner sees other miners that are not installed in the same hexagon, it will get extra rewards on top of the even distribution of tokens.

**We encourage you to follow the rules and guidelines for installation to ensure the best performance and highest rewards for your gateway. The tokenomics are designed in a way that the more clients a network has, the higher the price of the token, so it is the goal of the keeper to provide a professional-grade network service for our clients. By providing high-quality coverage and staying online, you not only increase your own rewards but also contribute to the overall success of the Chirp network. Thank you for being a part of the Chirp community!**
