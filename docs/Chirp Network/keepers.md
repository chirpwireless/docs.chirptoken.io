# Keepers

Keepers are owners and operators of Blackbirds, which are terrestrial IoT gateways that form Chirp's decentralized network. These gateways play a crucial role in establishing a robust and distributed infrastructure for Chirp's technology. Keepers are responsible for deploying and maintaining Blackbirds, ensuring their proper functioning and connectivity within the network.

By operating Blackbirds, keepers contribute to the overall strength and reliability of Chirp's decentralized network. They help facilitate the transmission of data and signals between IoT devices, enabling seamless communication and interaction. In recognition of their contribution, Chirp may provide incentives or rewards to keepers, fostering their continued participation in the network.
