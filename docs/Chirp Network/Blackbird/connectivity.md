# Connectivity Options

## Ethernet Connection: 

Connect your Blackbird gateway to the internet using an Ethernet cable. This is the recommended and most stable connection option. Configure your gateway to use Ethernet as the primary connection type whenever possible.

## WiFi Connection: 

If Ethernet is not available or feasible, you can connect your Blackbird gateway to a WiFi network. However, please note that WiFi may not be as reliable as Ethernet, so it should only be used as a secondary option.

## Cellular Connection: 

Your Blackbird gateway is equipped with a Chirps SIM card. 

Important Note: Chirps SIM card is used as a backup or a primary connectivity option. In case of a backup, If your gateway loses its internet connection via Ethernet or WiFi, it will automatically switch to the Chirps Cellular network and will incur fees for internet usage. This feature ensures continuous connectivity and protects your rewards and also provides carrier-grade connectivity to to networks clients. There is a one time 8$ activation charge + 70c Monthly fee for all keepers that will be subtracted from the Access Badge. 

If you are installing the gateway in a remote area without internet access, you can configure it to use the Chirps network's SIM card as a primary connection option. For Blackbirds, the special rate for internet usage is 0.0042 cents per megabyte (MB) and is signifficantly lower than for Chirps cellular clients.

Your Blackbird gateway transmits small amounts of data from IoT devices over the internet, as well as some logs from the gateway that monitor its connectivity status. When connected via the Cellular network, only essential information is transmitted to minimize data usage.

By using the Chirps SIM card, all network payments remain within the network ecosystem and contribute to the value of $CHIRP.
