# Blackbird

Blackbird miners provide signal coverage to surrounding residences and businesses, creating redundancy when deployed in multiple locations. In case of a power outage, IoT devices continue to function and connect to other miners, ensuring uninterrupted control and monitoring of assets.

The Blackbird miner supports both 2.4 GHz LoRa and Sub-GHz LoRaWAN frequencies, with the latter being country-specific due to regulatory differences. Chirp's network, however, operates on the globally license-free 2.4 GHz LoRa frequency, allowing devices to roam seamlessly worldwide.

Equipped with Semtech's latest SX1303 chipset, Blackbird miners in Chirp's network offer a competitive edge over other IoT networks. The miner, combined with advanced geolocation technology using Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) techniques, enables Chirp to locate IoT devices without built-in GPS trackers, particularly benefiting low-power applications.

Besides long-range capabilities, the Blackbird miner supports close-range protocols such as Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Thread, facilitating communication with nearby devices using these protocols.
