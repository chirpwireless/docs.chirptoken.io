# Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you begin the installation process of the Blackbird LoRaWAN gateway/miner, please ensure that you have the following tools, materials, and equipment ready. Some of these items may not be included in the package and need to be purchased separately.

## Tools and Materials {#tools-and-materials}

1. **Mounting hardware**: Depending on the type of surface you plan to mount the Blackbird gateway/miner on, you may need to purchase appropriate mounting brackets, screws, and anchors. These may include:
   - Pole mounting brackets and clamps for attaching the device to a pole or mast
   - Wall mounting brackets and screws for attaching the device to a wall or other flat surface
   - Roof mounting hardware for attaching the device to a rooftop

2. **Ethernet cable**: A high-quality, outdoor-rated Ethernet cable is required to connect the Blackbird gateway/miner to your network. The cable should be long enough to reach from the device's location to your network equipment.

3. **Ethernet surge protector**: To protect your network equipment and the Blackbird gateway/miner from potential damage caused by electrical surges, it is recommended to use an Ethernet surge protector. This device should be installed between the outdoor Ethernet cable and your indoor network equipment.

4. **Lightning arrester**: In areas prone to lightning strikes, it is highly recommended to install a lightning arrester to protect the Blackbird gateway/miner and your network equipment from damage. The lightning arrester should be installed on the mounting pole or mast, and properly grounded according to local electrical codes.

5. **Power source**: Ensure that you have a reliable power source available near the installation site, either through an outdoor-rated power outlet or by using a Power over Ethernet (PoE) injector.

6. **Ladder or lift**: Depending on the height of the installation, you may need a ladder or a lift to safely access the mounting location.

7. **Basic hand tools**: You will need basic hand tools, such as a drill, screwdriver, wrench, and wire stripper, for the installation process.

## Site Selection {#site-selection}

Before installing the Blackbird LoRaWAN gateway/miner, carefully select an appropriate outdoor location that meets the following criteria:

1. **Visibility**: Choose a location with the most unobstructed line of sight to the surrounding area. This will ensure the best possible coverage for your LoRaWAN network.

2. **Height**: Mount the device as high as possible, ideally on a rooftop or a tall pole, to maximize its coverage range.

3. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the installation site is easily accessible for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes.

4. **Weather protection**: Avoid installing the device in areas prone to flooding, excessive moisture, or direct exposure to harsh weather conditions.

5. **Security**: Choose a location that minimizes the risk of theft or vandalism.

Once you have gathered all the necessary tools, materials, and equipment, and have selected an appropriate installation site, you can proceed with the installation process as described in the following sections of this manual.
