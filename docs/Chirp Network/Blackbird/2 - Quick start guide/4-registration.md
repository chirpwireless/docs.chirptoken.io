# Blackbird Registration

## Step One (Connect to the gateway's WiFi access point)

After properly mounting your gateway, take out your cellular phone and open the "WiFi Connections". If the gateway is powered on, you will see a WiFi access point named "Chirp-XXXX" (XXXX represents gateway-specific numbers). Connect your phone to this access point. Password is the same as the access point name Chirp-XXXX.

**It is strongly recommended to stay close to the gateway (around 5 meters) during the registration process to ensure a stable connection.**
