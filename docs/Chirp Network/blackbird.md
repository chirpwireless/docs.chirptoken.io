# Blackbird

The Blackbird gateway supports both 2.4 GHz LoRa and Sub-GHz LoRaWAN frequencies. However, it's important to note that Sub-GHz LoRaWAN frequencies can be country-specific, and devices designed for one country may not work in another country due to regulatory variations (similar to how cell phones may not roam across different countries). On the other hand, Chirp's entire network operates on the 2.4 GHz LoRa frequency, making it the first public network utilizing this frequency. The 2.4 GHz frequency is license-free globally, enabling devices on Chirp's network to seamlessly roam worldwide.

All Blackbird gateways in Chirp's network are equipped with Semtech's latest chipset, SX1303, providing Chirp with further competitive advantage over other IoT networks.

With the combination of the Blackbird gateway and advanced geolocation technology utilizing Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) techniques and fine timestamping, Chirp can determine the outdoor location of IoT devices that do not have built-in GPS trackers. This technique, utilizing TDOA, is particularly beneficial for low-power applications.

In addition to long-range capabilities, the Blackbird gateway also supports close-range communication protocols such as Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Thread. This allows the gateway to facilitate communication with devices utilizing these protocols in proximity.

The Blackbird gateway provides signal coverage to nearby residences and businesses and to the keeper himself. By deploying multiple Blackbird gateways in a neighborhood, a redundancy is created. In the event of a power outage at a particular business or residence, IoT devices continue to function and seamlessly connect to other gateways in the area, ensuring that owners can still control and monitor their assets even during power outages.
