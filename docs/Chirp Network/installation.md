## Step One: 

IMPORTANT! Do not power on the gateway until the antennas are attached to avoid damaging the concentrators.

To assemble the gateway, attach the antennas to the gateway, ensuring that the antenna frequency matches the gateway frequency. As gateways are high-quality, expensive equipment, it is highly recommended to protect them from lightning and static. It is strongly suggested to install type N lightning arresters (male to female) (not included) between the antennas and the gateway and ground the lightning arresters and the gateway.
