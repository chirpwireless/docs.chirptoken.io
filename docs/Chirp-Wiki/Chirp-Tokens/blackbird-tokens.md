# Blackbird Token Generation

## Chirp Tokens
**[Blackbirds](../Chirp-Wiki/Hardware/Blackbird.md)** are IoT **[Gateways](../Chirp-Wiki/IoT-Protocols/LoRa/LoRa-Hardware.md)** as well and Chirp **Miners**, able to generate **[Chirpâ€™s proprietary crypto token](../Chirp-Wiki/Chirp-Tokens/chirp-tokens.md)** as rewards for providing IoT coverage for nearby users, or by facilitating the transfer of data and information on the Chirp Network. 

## Proof-of-Coverage

The first method through which a **[Blackbird](../Chirp-Wiki/Hardware/Blackbird.md)** generates [tokens] (../Chirp-Wiki/Chirp-Tokens/chirp-tokens.md), and the dominant way in which these will be distributed for the first few years from the launch of the Chirp Network, is Proof-of-Coverage. 

This is a mechanism that rewards users for providing IoT coverage in a way that can be validated and proven by other **Gateways** or **Master Gateways** on the Chirp Network, even when no IoT user uses the network to transfer data at this time. 
The validation process involves an algorithm where multiple **[Blackbirds](../Chirp-Wiki/Hardware/Blackbird.md)** interact in order to test the validity of each one of them, in addition to a series of validation tests on the internet connection and through GPS. 

## Data Transfer Rewards

**[Blackbirds](../Chirp-Wiki/Hardware/Blackbird.md)** listen for IoT devices that communite with the Chirp Network using either one of the installed communication protocols. When a connection is established, and data is transferred from an IoT device to a **[Blackbird](../Chirp-Wiki/Hardware/Blackbird.md)**, to be then interpreted and sent through the internet, the Keeper that owns the **[Blackbird](../Chirp-Wiki/Hardware/Blackbird.md)** that mediated this interaction will be rewarded with tokens proportional to the number of bits that were sent by the **IoT device**. 

The User who owns the **IoT Device** pays for the use of the **Chirp Network** by buying **[Chirp Tokens](../Chirp-Wiki/Chirp-Tokens/chirp-tokens.md)**  using fiat money, which once they are used transform into Data Credits. These are only partially reminted into **[Chirp Tokens](../Chirp-Wiki/Chirp-Tokens/chirp-tokens.md)** when they are received by the Keeper, so the total supply of Chirp tokens in circulation will always reduce in time.

## A spoofing-free network

A spoofed **[Blackbird](../Chirp-Wiki/Hardware/Blackbird.md)**, that was hacked and tempered with, will be unable to pass through these validation tests, and will therefore not generate any **[tokens](../Chirp-Wiki/Chirp-Tokens/chirp-tokens.md)** to its owner.
