# Intro to Chirp

As the digital world continues to grow and evolve, so does the need for more ways to connect devices, people, places, things, to transfer and generate value, solve problems and communicate. Chirp creates a decentralized wireless network capable to support broadband internet at affordable enough prices that it can be easily implemented around the world, as well as a unique multi-band and multi-protocol solution able to support all existing IoT devices.

Chirp is the first crypto project capable to sustain wireless connectivity for all domains – Broadband and IoT, residential and commercial – through the synergy between dual-band 2.4GHz and sub-GHz LoRa, BLE, and Zigbee for your connected devices as well as wireless internet at fibre speeds using Fibre-over-air. Chirp is created to provide a versatile, safe and sustainable network with scalability, low power consumption and low computational effort, using proprietary hardware and a common software ecosystem for all corners of connectivity.

Chirp is the only project currently on the market capable of covering both the broadband and the IoT telecommunications market, providing a timely implementation of the essential infrastructure for the evolution of technology into a digital future. By providing Gigabyte-speed internet to end-users, consumers and businesses, we complement the work of traditional ISP, compensating for their lack of investment efficiency in optimising roll-out for propagation of technologies that provide significantly higher speeds instead of prioritising reach and expansion.

The unique combination of IoT and traditional Broadband communication / services provides us with the potential to construct a unique service ecosystem as well unique synergies maximising the potential uses of both IoT and Broadband in the integrated digital era.
