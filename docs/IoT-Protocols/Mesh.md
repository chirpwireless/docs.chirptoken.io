# What is a Mesh Network?

Mesh networking is a way of creating networks in which devices communicate with each other directly and dynamically, as opposed to through a central point such as a central router. In a mesh network, there are multiple paths between devices, allowing data to be routed around any obstacles, or jumping over malfunctioning equipment, in order to make the network more robust.

## Why Mesh Networking Matters for Chirp?
Chirp's Mesh Networking is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and flexible solution for IoT networks. It offers several key benefits, including:
1.	Improved Reliability: With multiple paths between Blackbirds, and a plethora of devices to chose from given the decentralized nature of the network, mesh networks can route data around any obstacles or failures, making the network more reliable. This self-healing network architecture means that even if a device fails, the network can continue to operate seamlessly and maintain connectivity. This level of interoperability makes it possible to engage in increasingly more complicated and compelx automation applications using the Chirp Network, increasing its reach and potential usecases.
2.	Enhanced Security: Chirp's Mesh Networking uses advanced encryption techniques to protect data, particularly the cryptographic guarantee resulting from the Chirp Consensus Protocol, making it a secure solution for IoT networks. The decentralized nature of mesh networks also makes it incredibily difficult for cyber criminals to access sensitive information, because it increases exponentially the number of devices that need to be captured before the netowork's functionality is at all affected. 
3.	Scalability: Chirp's Mesh Networking can easily scale to meet the growing demands of IoT networks due to the decentralized architecture and the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs as a structure for the crypto ledger, making it a future-proof solution for a very long time. With the ability to add new Blackbirds easily in a decentralized manner, lead by the followers/Miners of the Chirp project, the network can be expanded easily with virtually limitless transactions on the chain. Chirp's Mesh Networking is ideal for businesses and organizations that require a scalable solution for IoT networking.
4.	Service Level Agreement (SLA): An SLA is a formal agreement between a service provider and a customer that outlines the level of service that the customer can expect to receive. In the case of Chirp, the SLA ensures that users receive a certain level of network performance, such as a minimum amount of bandwidth, and guarantees that the network will be available a certain percentage of time. This is only possible to enable using the Mesh Architecture, and is a significant improvement over many small or local IoT networks.

## Why Mesh Matters
Chirp's Mesh Networking is a true game-changer for IoT networking. With its improved reliability, enhanced security, scalability, and user-friendly experience, Chirp's Mesh Networking is an ideal solution for businesses and organizations looking to take their IoT networks to the next level. Whether you are looking to connect IoT devices in your home, office, or industrial setting, Chirp's Mesh Networking provides the solution you need to get the most out of your IoT devices.
