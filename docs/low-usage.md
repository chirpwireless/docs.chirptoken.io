# Low Network Usage Scenario

## How does it work?

In order to not depend on the whim of the market, a mechanism to improve the performance of the **[Chirp Token](chirp-tokens.md)** during low network usage periods exists. An example of such a scenario would be when not enough devices are available, or early in the lifetime of the Network, due to the time taken to scale up production and the time required for **[Blackbirds](Mining/Blackbird.md)**  and Devices to ship and be installed. 

Another scenario would be the exit of a major user, such as a commercial partner that uses the Network of an integral part of their operation, in which case this regulating mechanism prevents them having significant negative impact on the evolution of the Network.

The decreased usage of the Network results in a much lower amount of burnt tokens, therefore the total quantity of **[Chirp Tokens](chirp-tokens.md)** on the market and in circulation increases significantly. The lower number of tokens burned and the steady release of tokens through mining causes, if significant quantities of tokens are sold, a temporary price decrease for the **[Chirp Token](chirp-tokens.md)**.

The decrease in the price of Chirp results in a higher quantity of **[Chirp Tokens](chirp-tokens.md)** to be required for buying the same amount of IoT data on the Network, because this is represented by **[Access Badges](access-badges.md)** which are fixed price in relation to the fiat dollar (USD). Buying 100kb of IoT traffic on the Chirp Network will cost more **[Chirp Tokens](chirp-tokens.md)** than previously, which will increase the demand of the **[Chirp Token](chirp-tokens.md)** on the market, absorbing the excess of tokens on sale. 

## Protecting the Network for long-term growth

By increasing the number of tokens that get bought from the market proportional to the amount sold, the price of **[Chirp Tokens](chirp-tokens.md)** will start to increase, causing stabilization of the price of the **[Chirp Token](chirp-tokens.md)**.

This mechanism protects the value of IoT traffic on the network, and improves the stability of long-term rewards for both early and late adopters of the technology. 

The **[Chirp Token](chirp-tokens.md)** is better protected from market volatility and instability, making it better capable to weather the storms in the crypto-space and wider economy, with better correlation to the actual cost of the service provided, IoT coverage, which makes it not dependent from speculation in the manner seen in other cryptocurrencies.
