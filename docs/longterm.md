# Chirpâ€™s Long-term Approach

## Built for the Long-Term
Chirp's economy is designed with long-term sustainability in mind. Unlike many crypto projects, which are focused on short-term gains and "get-rich-quick" schemes, Chirp's reward distribution is scheduled to occur over several years. This ensures that the network will continue to grow and thrive for years to come, rather than being a temporary flash in the pan.
Sustainability is also achieved through a proper mechanism to adjust supply according to token demand. This is why Chirp has implemented a burning mechanism, which converts the revenue generated by the network into literal token consumption. This ensures that the network remains stable and sustainable, even as technology and market conditions evolve.

## The Flywheel Model
Chirp's economy is built on a flywheel model, which creates a virtuous cycle of growth and expansion. By incentivizing upgrades and expansions, Chirp is prepared for whatever the future may bring. This means that all network participants know, from the start, what they can count on.

## Real-World Adoption
One of the key principles of Chirp is practical, real-world adoption. By combining existing technology with blockchain, Chirp is able to achieve decentralization and ensure its longevity. This means that Chirp is not just a theoretical concept, but a practical solution that can be used in the real world.

## Investing in Chirp
As the Chirp network continues to grow and evolve, there are many opportunities for investors to get involved. The first sale will consist of bundles of Chirp Tokens and a Blackbird Miner, open to people who signed up on the Chirpwireless.io Waitlist. Next, there will be a seed round open to large investment funds with a minimum investment of over $1M. Finally, there will be an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) for the general public.
Investing in Chirp is not just about short-term gains, but about being a part of a sustainable and revolutionary wireless network that is changing the way we connect and communicate. With a focus on sustainability and real-world adoption, Chirp is setting the standard for the future of wireless technology.
