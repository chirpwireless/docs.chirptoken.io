# Cardinal DAO

## Governance and the DAO

The **[Cardinal](docs/Hardware/Cardinal/Cardinal.md)** project will have a decentralized governance system with a built-in voting mechanism. This will allow token holders to vote on important issues regarding the operation of their local ISP antenna. 

It will also use an internal governance system where users can vote on how they want their tokens to be used or transferred. 
Crypto governance is the process of making decisions on how to move forward with **[Cardinal's](docs/Hardware/Cardinal/Cardinal.md)** development. 
This includes voting and consensus-building processes that help determine which features get implemented and how they are implemented.

## The selling point:

The Cardinal DAO is already significantly above the average speeds in developed nations, and comparing roll-out costs and subscriptions prices, it likely will remain so for many years to come. 

Regardless, the very low price and relatively large modularity of the antennas permits breaking down a large community project into small parts, making it easy to make upgrades in the future. 

Essentially, a single antenna provides internet to a predefined number of people, however when more antennas are needed, more antennas can be installed, each one potentially easier to install than the last.
