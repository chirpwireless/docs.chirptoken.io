# Rewarding Network Participants
Stakeholders in the Chirp network are rewarded for their role in growing and sustaining the network’s economy. The majority of token emissions are intended to reward network participants. This is done in accordance with the Chirp tokenomics.

## Supply and Distribution
The $CHIRP token has a supply of 300 million tokens, which will be mined over a period of 50 years. The tokens are distributed to network stakeholders such as Network Keepers, Validators, Token Reserve, Investors, and Team, as they are mined. Investor rewards will be fully distributed over a 10-year period and Team rewards will take 15 years to be distributed.

## Halving Mechanism
The supply of $CHIRP tokens follows a halving mechanism, similar to that of Bitcoin. The supply of new tokens is cut in half every four years, and the rate of inflation is impacted by the reduction of the token supply. This helps to factor in the cost decrease cycle of the network’s gateways and underlying technology and incentivizes growth from an early stage.

## Rewards
Rewards play a crucial role in bootstrapping network growth and are designed to ensure project longevity and alignment with stakeholder goals. The rate of token emissions is dynamic, and 45% of all token emissions are granted to Network Keepers in the first four years, increasing to 90% by the end of the token’s emission schedule. Validators will be rewarded at a constant rate of 5% of token emissions.

## Incentivized for the long-term
In conclusion, $CHIRP is designed to incentivize the rollout of a global decentralized wireless network, balancing supply and demand for the token. Its distribution schedule, governance mechanism, and reward structure all serve to ensure that the network is built for long-term success.
