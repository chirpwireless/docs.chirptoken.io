# Investing in Chirp

## Who we are
The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly expanding, connecting more devices and creating more opportunities for data collection and analysis, remote control of devices and automation solution at different levels of complexity throughout a large and continuously expanding series of commercial, industrial and residential sectors. However, the growth of IoT has also highlighted the need for a robust, sustainable, and decentralized network to support it. This is where Chirp comes in.

## Our strategy
Chirp aims to be the network of everything, powering connectivity supported by a range of communication technologies. By leveraging crypto technology, Chirp aligns incentives among its different stakeholders, both for encouraging the usage of the network through its accessibility compared to other alternatives due to making great use of the decentralized infrastructure roll-out model that saves on OPEX and splits CAPEX, as well as making use of synergies and economies of scale from using multiple communication technologies in a single full product. Furthermore, technological dividends  resulting from the novelty and innovative structure of the network reward those supporting it.

## Investing for the everyman
Investors have a unique opportunity to be a part of this revolutionary network by funding its development through the various investment rounds offered by Chirp. The first investment opportunity for small investors is the bundle sale of Chirp Tokens and a Blackbird Miner, which will be open to people who have signed up on the Chirpwireless.io Waitlist. The Blackbird Miner is a gateway device that provides coverage for the Chirp network and earns rewards in the form of Chirp Tokens for the coverage and data transfers provided. The equivalent token prices for the tokens sold in the bundle sale will be lower than those at the token launch

## Why a Bundle Sale?
The Bundle Sale is available in lieu of a conventional private sale in order to enable people from nations that disallow private person participation in initial financing rounds and private sales, such that anyone from all across the world – from the USA to China – can be an early adopter and benefit from the large pay-outs of being amongst the first to get rewarded in the test-net phase – dividing Proof-of-Coverage token rewards to the fewest people!

## Investing for large investors
For larger investors and investment funds, the next investment opportunity is the seed round, with a minimum investment of over 1 million dollars. This round provides investors with a chance to be a part of the early stages of Chirp's development and to have a greater influence on the direction of the project. For those interested in getting in touch, you may contact us by e-mail to info@chirpwireless.io .

## Initial Exchange Offering
Finally, there will be the Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) for Chirp Tokens. This is the final investment opportunity before the launch of the Chirp network. The IEO will allow investors to purchase Chirp Tokens at a discounted price, providing an opportunity to earn a return on investment as the value of the token increases. 

## IoT innovation and the future of decentralized IoT blockchain solutions
Investing in Chirp is not only an opportunity to financially benefit from the growth of the network, but it also allows investors to play a crucial role in shaping the future of IoT. By supporting Chirp's development and growth, investors are helping to create a sustainable and decentralized network that will power the next generation of connected devices and services – in essence getting at the forefront of the future of Industry, Healthcare, Agriculture, Smart Home and Smart City Automation solutions, just to name a few. Whether you're a small investor looking to get in on the ground floor or a larger investment fund looking for a more strategic partnership, Chirp offers a range of investment opportunities that are sure to suit your needs.
