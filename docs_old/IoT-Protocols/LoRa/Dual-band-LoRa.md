# LoRa Frequency Bands

## What is a LoRa Device?

Just like any other radio technology, LoRa has to operate within a imited range of radio frequencies. These frequency are often the unlicensed frequency bands, where the user does not need to seek approval from governmental institutions or pay licenses. Older technologies used to be limited to a single unlicensed band, called the sub-GHz band, which depended on which country, continent or region the devices were installed.

Chirp uses the latest improvements in LoRa technology that make it possible to use LoRa on the 2.4GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical frequency band, a newer unlicensed frequency band designed for data transfer and which is also used by the majority of WiFi routers, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and many other technologies.

The 2.4GHz frequency band makes it possible to send more data and makes all devices compatible with the same LoRa Gateway, regardless of where the device is installed.

Chirp offers dual-band LoRa, so you can make use of both the benefits of the longer range of the sub-GHz regional band, smoothly transition your devices from existing LoRa installations to the Chirp network, as well as make use of the advanced, higher data-rate and bandwith, 2.4GHz ISM LoRa.



## How does LoRa handle interferrence?

Despite the fact that the 2.4GHz band is shared between multiple communication and data transfer protocols, the creators and developers of LoRa made it very resilient to interference by making it so LoRa chirps are situated right in the space in between the frequency bands of other protocols, as well as by making sure that LoRa uses very different specifications regarding how often, at what power, and how different the radio signals are transmitted compared to other technologies . 
According to Semtech, the creators of the SX1280 chip that enabled 2.4GHz LoRa, the only way in which interference between LoRa and BLE can be created is if the two chips transmitting the full amount of data possible are less than a few centimeters from one another.
