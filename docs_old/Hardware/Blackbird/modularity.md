# Hardware Modularity in IoT: 

## What is modularity?
Hardware modularity refers to the ability to easily upgrade or replace components within a device, without having to replace the entire device. This is particularly important in the IoT, where devices may need to be updated or replaced frequently in order to keep up with the latest advances in technology.
One of the key advantages of hardware modularity is that it allows for future-proofing of devices. This means that devices can be updated or replaced with new components as needed, without having to replace the entire device. This can save both time and money, as well as reducing e-waste.

## Futureproofing Blackbirds
The Chirp Network is at the forefront of this issue, with its Blackbird Gateway. The Blackbird is designed to be a multi-protocol, dual-band antenna device that can be easily deployed in a plug-and-play fashion. The Blackbird uses the latest technology to enable the use of the 2.4GHz ISM free radio band, providing global compatibility with devices across all regions, resolving the Roaming Issue and being able to communicate with devices cross-borders.

## How to upgrade?
One of the key features of the Blackbird is its modularity. The essential components related to the communication protocols can be replaced as easily as unscrewing the box and changing a card or component. This ensures future upgradeability of the Blackbird with potential to receive software updates and hardware upgrades over the full operational period. This future-proofs the Blackbird for future changes in the IoT infrastructure needs and trends, allowing the introduction of new technology and ensuring that hardware can never become obsolete, even if it operated with proper maintenance over the full 30 year period.

## Upgrades for remote installations
In addition to its modularity, the Blackbird also offers a satellite or LTE backhaul that ensures availability when the internet isn't available or for remote devices. Transactions are done using the Chirp Token, the network's native cryptocurrency.

## Chirp's Blackbird Gateway is Futureproofing the Industry
The Chirp Network's Blackbird Gateway is a prime example of how hardware modularity can benefit the IoT industry. By allowing for easy upgrades and replacements, the Blackbird ensures that devices can stay up to date with the latest advances in technology, without having to replace the entire device. This can save both time and money, as well as reducing e-waste. With the Blackbird, the Chirp Network is leading the way in the IoT industry, and setting a new standard for hardware modularity.
