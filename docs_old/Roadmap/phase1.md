# Phase I – Pre-Launch Stage – 2022 

## Assembling the team
During the pre-launch stage in 2022, Chirp's team of IoT, Telecommunications, and Software specialists worked tirelessly to bring the vision of a wireless system connecting people and IoT devices in a single network to fruition. The team, lead by our Chief Product Officer (CPO) from Deutsche Telekom, was comprised of specialists from various esteemed organizations such as the World Bank, T-Mobile, Huawei, VK, VEON, and Cambridge University. With the addition of more than 20 members, including 6 PhDs, the team was able to expand and further develop the prototype network.

## First prototype's live!
One of the major accomplishments during this phase was the successful production of the prototype network, which was tested with the first Master Node installed in Germany and multiple Blackbirds installed for further testing and fine-tuning. The team also secured multiple manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors for the Blackbird Gateway Miner, and were in the process of preparing for the sale of the Blackbirds and the first chance to buy tokens through the Bundle Sale. The Waitlist for participating ended in December 2022 and listed over 50,000 people.

## Expanding our Media Presence
In addition to the hardware development, the team also focused on expanding the community and social media presence by creating channels on popular platforms such as Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Medium, Reddit, and Youtube. This allowed for easy communication and engagement with potential users and investors, and helped to create a strong and active community around the Chirp project.

## Embedded Programming
Embedded programming was also a major focus during this phase, as the team worked on creating the firmware and Operating System (OS) of the Blackbird Gateways. These gateways are the backbone of the Chirp network and ensuring that they function correctly and securely was a top priority - turning a classic IoT Gateway into our own Blackbird. The team also conducted cybersecurity audits to ensure that the network and its devices were protected from potential threats. The development of the dashboard front-end and back-end was also started during this phase, providing a user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring the IoT devices connected to the Chirp network.

## Rust
Rust development for the network backend was also started during this phase, which allowed for the creation of a robust and efficient backend system that can handle the demands of a large-scale IoT network. This development was crucial for ensuring that the Chirp network can scale to meet the needs of its users as it grows.

## Marketing 
Marketing was also a crucial aspect during this phase, as the team assembled a marketing strategy and resources. The hiring of a Chief Market Officer (CMO) was done to lead the planning and execution of the marketing strategy. The goal was to create awareness and interest in the Chirp project and its capabilities, as well as to attract potential investors and users.

## We've got a Dashboard already!
Finally, the User Dashboard was developed, providing a visual representation for all IoT operations including connecting Devices, Gateways, collecting data, issuing commands to devices (e.g. commanding smart plugs, solenoid valves, etc.) and locating things (as well as monitoring their movement across time) and saving and visualizing data received from IoT devices. This dashboard was an essential tool for users to manage and monitor their IoT devices on the Chirp network.

## Another full year is near
In summary, the pre-launch stage in 2022 was a critical period for Chirp, as the team worked on the development and production of the hardware, software and infrastructure needed for the launch of the network. With the successful completion of this phase, the Chirp team is now well-positioned to move forward with the launch and growth of the network, as it continues to work towards connecting people and IoT devices in a single network.
