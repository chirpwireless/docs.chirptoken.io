# Smart Contracts for Chirp

## What are Smart Contracts?
Smart contracts are digital agreements that are self-executing and self-enforcing. They are written in computer code, and are stored and replicated on the blockchain. In simple terms, they are a way to automate trust and enforce rules in digital transactions. Chirp uses smart contracts in several ways to ensure the security, efficiency, and scalability of its ecosystem.

## How is Chirp using Smart Contracts?

One of the key applications of smart contracts in Chirp is the transmission of tokens as payment proportional to network bandwidth from Gateway users. Gateway users, also known as Network Keepers, provide coverage for the network and are rewarded with $CHIRP tokens for their service. Smart contracts ensure that the payment is automatically and accurately calculated based on the amount of bandwidth used, either on the basis of the number of bits transmitted or the subscription plan credited to the wallet.

Another important application of smart contracts in Chirp is the generation of Access Badges. Access Badges are used by Network Users to access the Chirp network and connect their devices, by keeping the $CHIRP token correlated with the inherent value of IoT network traffic – because of the two token system. Smart contracts automate the process of creating and distributing Access Badges when Network Users or their devices initiate any form of Network usage, ensuring that only authorized users have access to the network and that both Users and Keepers can quantify their value transactions on the same token price and utility agreement. 

Smart contracts are fundamental to the implementation of the tokenomics of Chirp. They perform token burns, which reduce the total supply of tokens, indirectly increasing their value, to prevent liquidity issues or oversupply and to maintain long-term value security in the face of an unstable market environment – essentially stabilising mathematically the token. They also enable the distribution of tokens to agents as rewards and profits from transactions, staking, and investments. Essentially, smart contracts are used for token issuances and emissions, which are essential for the proof-of-coverage mechanism that secures the Chirp network and distributes the primary drives or early incentivised and accelerated roll-out.
Furthermore, smart contracts are used to construct the Chirp Consensus Protocol, which is the mechanism that ensures the integrity and security of the network. They also play a role in the cyber security considerations of the network, providing an additional layer of protection against malicious actors.

Another important use of smart contracts in Chirp is miner validation and registration to the network. Miners are responsible for validating and recording transactions on the Chirp DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). Smart contracts ensure that only authorized miners can participate in the network and that their actions are recorded and transparent. Furthermore, Miner Validation and Confirmation, Relocation, Initial Installation, Upgrades and other Miner-related activities are automated using Smart Contracts in order to make the Chirp Network properly decentralised.
Finally, smart contracts enable the transformation of Access Badges into proportional network access and the rewarding of Keepers for traffic. This ensures that network resources are allocated efficiently and fairly among users, and that Keepers are incentivized to provide coverage and support for the network.

## Importance of Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are a fundamental component of the Chirp ecosystem, providing security, efficiency, and automation to the network's operations. They enable the creation of a decentralized and self-governing network that aligns incentives among its different stakeholders.
